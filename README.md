We are going to make a Minecraft mod. but itsn't will be a simple mod, it's going to be a very big project. I want to create a mod that will take you through the History, discoveries,  the development of physics, chemistry and biology.

But I can't do it alone

So please help me.

if you can code, that's great, but if you can't, you can help a lot. We also need texture makers and 3d modellers.

So join and let's make it happen together!
